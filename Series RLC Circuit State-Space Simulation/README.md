# Series RLC Circuit State-Space Simulation

## Project Overview

This MATLAB project simulates the time-domain transient response of a series RLC (Resistor-Inductor-Capacitor) circuit. By modeling the circuit using state-space differential equations, the script calculates and visualizes the capacitor voltage and circuit current over time when subjected to a constant DC voltage source.

This project demonstrates the application of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) and numerical integration (`ode45`) to analyze electrical system dynamics.

## System Description

The circuit is modeled as a series loop containing a DC voltage source, a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor. The system is defined by the following state variables:

* $X_1 = V_c$ (Capacitor Voltage)
* $X_2 = i$ (Circuit Current)

### Circuit Parameters

* **Input Voltage ($e$):** `60 V` (Constant DC Step)
* **Resistance ($R$):** `10 \Omega`
* **Inductance ($L$):** `1 H`
* **Capacitance ($C$):** `10 F`
* **Initial Conditions:** `Vc = 0 V`, `i = 0 A`

## Code Structure

The project consists of two parts:

1. **`RLC(t, X)`:** A custom MATLAB function that defines the system's state derivatives based on physical component values. It outputs the rate of change for the capacitor voltage and the circuit current.
2. **Main Execution Script:** Defines the initial zero-state conditions, runs the `ode45` numerical solver from `t = 0` to `t = 500` seconds, and generates side-by-side subplots plotting the system's response.

## How to Run

1. Ensure MATLAB is installed.
2. Save the main script and the `RLC` function in your working directory.
3. Run the main script.
4. A figure window will appear with two subplots:
* **Top Plot:** Capacitor Voltage ($V_c$) as it charges over time toward the steady-state source voltage.
* **Bottom Plot:** Circuit Current ($i$) as it peaks and eventually decays to zero once the capacitor is fully charged.
